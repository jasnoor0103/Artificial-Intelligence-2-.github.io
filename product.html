      <h1 style="font-size:80px;font-family:calbri;color: black;">Google Search</h1> 
  
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

   <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:calbri;color: whitesmoke;">The most fundamental activity on the internet is searching for things. And for the last decade and more, Google Search has been the go-to search engine to look for all sorts of stuff. So what makes Google Search such a powerful and accurate directory of the whole web? You guessed it right, it’s AI that is working behind the scenes. Whenever you are searching for things online, you are effectively using AI in the true sense.

Examples of Artificial Intelligence (Updated April 2021)
In the last 3-4 years, Google introduced some of the AI elements to improve the ranking of websites. Now, it uses AI on Google Search for recommending a specific part of the video based on your search query, readily suggests questions and answers that you might be interested in and smart search suggestions below the search result. It’s only because of AI that you rarely have to move to the 2nd page on Google Search. So if you were wondering about where do you interact with AI in daily life, well it’s Google Search.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
 <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:calbri;color: whitesmoke;">Google Lens is another Google service that is built on AI and has some great technology for fast and accurate optical recognition. It allows you to search for anything through images. Just point the camera to a shoe or a plant or an animal or a text, it can detect the type of subject and will provide precise information on that thing in just a few seconds. All of this is possible because of AI’s advancement in the field of optical recognition.


Not to mention, Google Lens can also do OCR now and you can extract texts from images easily. In fact, almost all the OCR software libraries like Tesseract or TensorFlow are built on AI to detect the characters on an image. When you use apps like Adobe Scan or Microsoft Office Lens, smart cropping and edge detection are actually powered by AI. So nonchalantly, you are actively using AI in your daily life and benefitting from it.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
 <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:calbri;color: whitesmoke;">AI is also being extensively used in image editing. remove.bg (visit) is one of the popular websites to remove the background of an image through AI. What used to take minutes through the Lasso tool can now be down algorithmically in just a few seconds.

Next, you have the “Enhance” tool that has finally arrived on professional image editing programs. Image editors can now literally enhance an image with the click of a button. Adobe recently introduced the Super Resolution feature that enhances the pixel by a factor of four, effectively improving detail, sharpness, and resolution of the image. It uses Machine Learning to interpolate adjacent pixels and reduce artifacts.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
 <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:calbri;color: whitesmoke;">Newer Apple Watches come with a Fall Detection feature that alerts the nearby emergency team when it senses you had a hard fall. It uses data from the accelerometer and gyroscope to sense the fall and leverages AI algorithms to accurately sense a hard fall. You may not know it, but due to AI, so many lives are being saved.

Examples of Artificial Intelligence (Updated April 2021)
Similarly, Google Pixel phones now come with Car Crash Detection which is trained on Machine Learning models of real-life car crashes. If the phone senses a car crash, it sends the location to your chosen contacts and also sends an alert to the response team. It’s safe to say that from software utilities to life-saving features, all of them are now powered by AI that we use in our daily life.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
 <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:calbri;color: whitesmoke;">Talking about AI, there is no better and more prominent display of this technology than what smart car and drone manufacturers are doing with it. Just a few years back, using a fully automatic car was a dream, however, now companies like Tesla have made so much progress that we already have a fleet of semi-automatic cars on the road.

Companies like Amazon and Walmart are heavily investing in drone delivery programs and it will become a reality far sooner than what you expect. If you think that’s far-fetched, do note that militaries all over the world are already using successful drone programs.

ai in car
Tesla cars are a prime example of how AI is impacting our daily life. Did you know that all the Tesla cars are connected and the things that your car learns are shared across all the cars? That means, if you had to take an unanticipated hard-left on a cross-road, all the Tesla cars will know how to maneuver that turn after they are updated. There are already more than 500,000 Tesla cars running in the US alone and that number is set to increase exponentially now that Tesla has solved its major production problems. With autonomous cars running on our roads and autonomous drones flying above us, you won’t be able to deny the impact of AI on our lives.</p>

     	 <h1 style="font-size:80px;font-family:calbri;color: black;">Video Games</h1>
      
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
 <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:calbri;color: whitesmoke;"> The video game industry is probably one of the earliest adopters of AI. The integration started very small with the use of AI to generate random levels that people can play. However, that has increased to a level that goes far beyond what one can even imagine.

On the large scale, we just observed OpenAI 5, developed by the company OpenAI which is being backed by Elon Musk, beating pro-level Dota 2 players in one on one matches while also beating amateur Dota 2 teams. This achievement is being hailed as a leapfrogging moment in the AI industry. Dota 2 is a strategy-based game where players have to make decisions every second, and beating pro players in such a dynamic game is a huge achievement for AI.
 Keeping the Dota 2 win aside for a while, let’s talk about how AI is infiltrating our normal gaming industry. Any game that you play has some sort of AI element to it. When you are playing a game such as PUBG or Fortnite, you essentially start against a couple of AI-powered bots and then move to play against real players. Even when you are playing a single-person story mode game, you are playing against AI bosses.

If you are playing racing games, you are racing against AI bots. Probably the most interesting use of AI we have seen in games is in the Middle Earth series of games where your enemies which are controlled by AI evolve based on their interaction with you and other gaming elements. I can go on and on about the use of AI in games, but that would make this article very long. Just know that if you play any game, you are using AI.</p>

     	 <h1 style="font-size:50px;font-family:calbri;color: black;">Security and Surveillance</h1>
      
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
 <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:calbri;color: whitesmoke;">While we can all debate the ethics of using a broad surveillance system, there’s no denying the fact that it is being used and AI is playing a big part in that. It is not possible for humans to keep monitoring multiple monitors with feeds from hundreds if not thousands of cameras at the same time, and hence, using AI makes perfect sense.

AI in security
With technologies like object recognition and facial recognition getting better and better every day, it won’t be long when all the security camera feeds are being monitored by an AI and not a human. While there’s still time before AI can be fully implemented, this is going to be our future.</p>

     	 <h1 style="font-size:70px;font-family:calbri;color: black;">Smart Speakers</h1>
      
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
 <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:calbri;color: whitesmoke;">Not for nothing, many believe that smart speakers are all set for a big boom in technology. Aside from controlling smart home devices, they are also up to the task for several things like sending quick messages, setting reminders, checking the weather and getting the latest news. And it’s this versatility that’s proving to be a decisive factor for them.

Amazon Echo
Led by the hugely popular Amazon Echo series, the global smart speaker market reached an unprecedented high in 2019 with sales of 149.9 million units, which is a significant increase of 70% in 2018. Moreover, the sales in Q4 2019 also saw a new record with a whopping 55.7 million units. Smart speakers are probably the most overt examples of use of AI in our real life.</p>
